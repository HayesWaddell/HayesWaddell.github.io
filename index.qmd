I am a senior neuroscience major at Macalester College, with minors in data science, biology, and psychology. I have conducted research on the effects of nicotine on a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm with an ethanol reward cue, combining my interest in neuroscience and behavior. Athletically, I play baseball for Macalester and was named to the All-MIAC team in 2023 and the All-Region Third Team in 2023. I also serve on the Macalester baseball leadership team for 2024. Outside of academics and sports, I enjoy cooking and spending time outdoors.
